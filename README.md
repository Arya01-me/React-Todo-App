# React-Todo-App
Created A " Todo App " Using ReactJS For The Frontend And The Firebase For The Back End. It Is A Fully Functional App Where You Can Add Your Todos Which On Adding Will Be Updated To Your Firebase Database And Also You Can Delete You Todos By Hitting The Delete Icon .. I Have Used Material UI And CSS For The Styling..
